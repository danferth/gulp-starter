# gulp-starter

After reinventing the wheel a few times I realized I just need a starting point with `gulp` to get the project going and can add to it as needed.

##Source & Destination
- styles, scripts & images start in dev folder
- saved to build folder

##Style sheets
- sourcemaps
- compile scss
- add vender prefixes
- minimize
- file size check

##Javascript
- concatenate
- jshint
- file size check

###Build process
- concatenate
- sourcemaps
- minimize
- file size check

##Images
- optimize file size

*This is a work in progress and can always like everything get entirely out of hand to the point of being just to specific and too large to use as a starting point.  At that pint this project will just be abandoned as it will just be another attempt at reinventing the wheel.*
